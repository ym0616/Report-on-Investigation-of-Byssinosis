# Report-on-Investigation-of-Byssinosis

In the 1700s, occupational medicine has grown to encompass an array of respiratory conditions, and one such condition is Byssinosis, a collection of respiratory symptoms elicited by exposure to raw non-synthetic textiles during their manufacturing process. Over the years, Byssinosis has been referred to as a cotton workerâ€™s lung, brown lung disease, Monday fever, and mill fever. In 1973, a large cotton textile company in North Carolina participated in a study to investigate the prevalence of byssinosis, a form of pneumoconiosis to which workers exposed to cotton dust are subject. The report data is collected from 5419 workers, with their workplace, employment years, whether or not to smoke, sex, and race defined, to find out the relationship or pattern between the byssinosis and the categories mentioned above. In this analysis report, we are going to investigate relationships between this disease on the one hand and smoking status, sex, race, length of employment, smoking, and dustiness of workplace on the other. In doing such, we will apply Chi-Square Null Distribution, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and Best Logistic Model methods to explore the data.
